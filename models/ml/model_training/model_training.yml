models:
  - name: feature_engineer_prepare_data
    description: Cleansed table for model training. Includes third party features, such as holiday flag, latitude and longitude. Identification columns have been removed.
     Categorical columns are represented as numeric. Data has been split into training and testing (30 day holdout).
  - name: demand_forecast_test
    description: Subset of the feature data (80%) to be used for model training.
  - name: demand_forecast_train
    description: Subset of the feature data (20%) to be used for model testing.
  - name: demand_forecast_train_demo
    description: Subset of the training data to be used for demonstration. The purpose of this subset is to show model training in around 30 seconds.
  - name: hyperparameter_tuning_df
    description: Table containing combinations of XGBoost hyperparameters cross joined with training data to be used in hyperparameter tuning.
  - name: hyperparameter_tuning_results
    description: The resulting performance (RMSE) of 27 XGBoost models trained in parrallel for each combination of hyperparameters .
  - name: model_training
    description: The feature importance from a menu item demand by location forecast model after the model (XGBoost) is trained in a Snowflake stored procedure with the best selected hyperparameters.
      The trained model is saved on a Snowflake stage.
  - name: demand_forecast_train_metrics
    description: The evaluation metrics on the training and test datasets, following deployment of the model in a Snowflake as a user-defined function.
